Instructions for running the program.

Program.py -> Program you want to run(like MiniMaxOpening.py, MiniMaxGame.py, ABOpening.py, etc.)
board1.txt -> text file which contains single line of the board position(like xxxxxxxWWxxxxxBBxxxxx)
board2.txt -> Empty file preferred, this file will contain the board position after running the program(The Output)
